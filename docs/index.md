Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale. Learn more about what Apache Flink is and see real world use-cases on our [website](https://flink.apache.org).

## Try Apache Flink

People come to Apache Flink from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope youâ€™ll find this section helpful.

  * If you prefer to learn by doing, start with one of our quickstart guides.
  * If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.

### For Application Developers

If you prefer to learn by doing, and have experience developing in Java or Scala, check out our practical tutorials.
Use Flink's Table Api and learn to build real time analytics pipelines to up to the moment insights.
Afterwards, walk through the DataStream tutorial to see how to build stateful event-driven applications for detecting fraudulant transactions in a stream of credit card transactions.

### For DBAs

Look at this neat sql client docker thing

### For DevOps

Plus we have a dockerized container to see what managing flink looks like in production just for you!
